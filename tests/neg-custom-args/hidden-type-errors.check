Explanation
===========

Tree: t12717.A.bar("XXX")

I tried to show that
  String
conforms to
  Int
but the comparison trace ended with `false`:
          
  ==> String  <:  Int
    ==> String  <:  Int (recurring)
      ==> String  <:  Int (recurring)
      <== String  <:  Int (recurring) = false
    <== String  <:  Int (recurring) = false
  <== String  <:  Int = false

The tests were made under the empty constraint
